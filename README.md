# C+Arch
This is a personal program to configure ArchLinux mainly, but also other Linux systems, for now the UI is been created, also a CLI version will be created, but the graphical version will be ready first, 
the goal as many other Apps or Programs of this type is just to configure easily things in Linux that normally takes a lot to do it, that is the main goal. 

May be there is a cool distro that everybody is using, but you're already using another but you still want some of the benefits of such cool distro right? Well may be instead of change the distro that you are already using it could be easier, and
instead there could be an App like this and even other Apps/Programs for Linux to replicate exactly things that are only possible in other distros, and that is one of the reasonable goals among others.

I will be very happy if some folks want to collaborate with this project, this could be something beneficial for so many people to help them not to change their system, sure.. there will be some impossible cases along the way but..
is just a matter of time until we can find a work around right? Exactly! that's what this apps is made for.
